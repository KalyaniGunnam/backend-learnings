# Tools Required To Develop and Run Java Programs

To write and run Java programs, you need some tools installed on your computer. Let’s break it down in simple terms:

First and foremost thing to execute Java program is we should have JDK(Java Development Kit) installed in our system.To download Java we will have JDK, JRE and ServerJRE. When we want to download JDK, it will come along with JRE. If we want to download only JRE, JRE will not come with JDK.

## 1. JDK (Java Development Kit) :
Think of JDK as a "toolbox" for Java developers. It has everything you need to create Java programs, like tools to write, compile and debug code. It also includes:
- JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Needed to run Java programs.
- Compiler: Converts your code into a language the computer understands.

You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use distributions like OpenJDK.

## 2. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) :
An IDE provides a comprehensive environment for writing, debugging and managing Java code.  Means An IDE is like a super-smart notepad designed for coding. It makes writing Java programs easier by offering helpful features like:
- Highlighting mistakes as you type.
- Showing suggestions for completing code.
- Helping you run and test your code quickly.

Some popular Java IDE’s include :
- **Eclipse** : A widely used open-source IDE with a rich set of features and plugins.
- **IntelliJ IDEA** : A powerful commercial IDE with intelligent code assistance and productivity tools.
- **NetBeans** : Another open-source IDE that offers features for Java development, including GUI builder and profiler.
- **Visual Studio Code** : It is another versatile and lightweight code editor that supports Java development through various extensions.

## 3. Text Editor :
Alternatively, you can use a simple text editor like Notepad++(windows), Sublime Text or Atom to write java code. These editors don’t have advanced features but are easy to use.

## 4. Compiler : 
A compiler is like a translator. When you write a Java program (in English-like code), the compiler translates it into a language your computer understands. The compiler in Java is called "Javac", and it comes with the JDK. It translates Java source code(.java files) into bytecode(.class files) that can be executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

## 5. Java Virtual Machine (JVM) :
JVM is a crucial component of the Java platform responsible to runs Java programs. It ensures your program works on any device that has JVM installed. When you install JDK, JVM is included, so you don’t have to worry about it.

## 6. Build Automation Tool :
If you’re working on big projects, tools like Maven or Gradle can help you:
- Organize your projects
- Add libraries you might need easily
- Automate repetitive tasks
Think of them as assistants to manage your project more efficiently.

## 7. Version Control System (Optional) :
If you’re collaborating with others or want to keep track of changes to your code, a version control system like Git is super helpful. You can also share your code with others on platforms like: GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket

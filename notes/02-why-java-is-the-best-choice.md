# Why We Create Software Applications

**Software Applications** are developed to solve human problems. To create such applications, a programming language is essential. Popular programming languages include **.NET, Python and Java**. However, for backend development in applications like Flipkart, Java is often the preferred choice. Let's explore why?

# Understanding Full-Stack Development

Before exploring why Java is a preferred choice, let us first understand what full-stack development is and how Java fits into it.

## What is full-stack development?
Full-stack refers to the combination of frontend and backend development required to create a complete application.

### Frontend Development

Frontend involves everything the user can see and interact with directly, also known as the User Interface (UI). Technologies used for frontend development include:
- **HTML**: For structuring content.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity.
- **Frameworks**: React or Angular are often used to enhance frontend functionality.

Example: In Flipkart, the pages displaying products, login fields and buttons are part of the frontend.

### Backend Development

Backend involves the logic and functionality that run behind the scenes to make the application work. It handles:
- Validating user inputs (e.g., verifying if a mobile number is valid).
- Processing user requests (e.g., sending an OTP to a valid mobile number).
- Providing responses (e.g., displaying account details upon successful login).

Example: When you click the login button, the backend: Verifies whether the mobile number exists in the database, Sends an OTP if the number is valid and Checks if the entered OTP is correct.

Backend technologies like Java, Python or .NET implement this logic. While the frontend remains the same (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), the backend technology determines the application's behavior.

# Full-Stack Developer Specializations

Your title as a full-stack developer depends on the backend technology you specialize in. While the frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, React, etc.) are largely consistent across projects, the backend technology defines your specialization:

- **Java Full-Stack Developer**: Backend development is done using Java (often with frameworks like Spring or Hibernate).
- **.NET Full-Stack Developer**: Backend development is done using .NET technologies.
- **Python Full-Stack Developer**: Backend development is done using Python (often with frameworks like Django or Flask).

Each specialization reflects the developer's proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies for that particular tech stack.

# Why Choose Java for Backend?

### scenario:
Let’s consider a business scenario involving two entrepreneurs operating with similar customer bases but choosing different backend technologies for their applications.

The first entrepreneur has 1 million customers and decides to build their application using Java for the backend. Meanwhile, the second entrepreneur, who also has 1 million customers, opts for Python as the backend technology for their application. The development timelines and costs for both applications are as follows:

- **Java-based application**: Development time was quoted at 8 months, with a cost of ₹2 crores.
- **Python-based application**: Development time was quoted at 4 months, with a cost of ₹1 crore.

Both entrepreneurs are satisfied with the development timelines and costs. After some time, their applications are ready for use. However, the real challenge begins when these applications go live and start handling actual user traffic.

Initially, both applications have an average of 10,000 users per day. This is a manageable load, and everything runs smoothly. However, during a festival season or a sale period, the number of users spikes significantly. Both applications see a sharp increase in traffic, reaching 1 lakh users per day. This sudden surge in traffic puts the applications to the test.

Here’s where the difference in backend technology becomes apparent.

Java-based application, known for its scalability and stability, is able to handle the sudden increase in traffic without any issues. Java’s robust memory management, efficient threading, and support for high concurrency allow the application to continue performing well even with the influx of users. During peak periods like a "Big Billion Sale," where traffic could increase to tens of millions of users, Java’s optimized performance ensures the application runs smoothly without crashing or slowing down.

In contrast, Python-based application, while performing well with normal traffic, begins to show signs of strain as the user count reaches 1 lakh. Python struggles to maintain the same level of performance under the increased load. Response times slow down, and there could be delays or timeouts as the system struggles to handle such a high volume of concurrent users. This leads to a poor user experience, as people may find the application slow to respond or even unresponsive at times.

# Conclusion:
Java is preferred for backend development in applications like Flipkart because of its:
- Scalability and stability under high load.
- Performance during traffic surges.
- Extensive libraries and frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.

While Python is great for rapid development, Java remains the go-to technology for applications requiring high concurrency, robustness, and large-scale performance.

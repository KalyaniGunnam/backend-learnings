# Why To Learn Java?

Before diving into Java, it's important to understand its significance compared to other programming languages and its areas of application. Many people, including myself, initially thought learning Java was unnecessary without knowing where and why it's used. Let's explore some stories about the Java programming language to grasp its importance and relevance in the real world.

# Where is Java Used?

Java is widely used in various fields, **from web development to enterprise applications** . To understand why Java is essential, let’s look at an example:

**Imagine you're visiting the Flipkart homepage and clicking the login button**

- You are prompted to enter your mobile number. The system checks whether the mobile number entered is valid or not:
  - If the mobile number is **invalid**, an error message will appear.
  - If the mobile number is **valid**, an OTP (One-Time Password) will be sent to your mobile.

**After receiving the OTP, you must enter it:**
- If the OTP is **incorrect**, the system will display an error message.
- If the OTP is **correct**, the system will grant access, displaying your account details (e.g., name, address, and previous orders).

This process is similar on other platforms like Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, and many others. All these functionalities are handled by **backend operations**, which java excels at, ensuring smooth user experiences.

# Why Do We Need Software Applications?

Software applications are crucial for automating tasks, managing vast amounts of data, and providing seamless user experiences. Let’s explore this with real-world scenarios:

## Scenario 1: Sending Money in the 1980s

Imagine it's the 1980s, and I want to send money to my family, who live far away. What options do I have? Earlier, sending money instantly was not possible. Technology was not as advanced as it is today. At that time, there was no PhonePe, Google Pay, or even proper bank accounts for everyone. Having a bank account was considered a status symbol, and many people, including my parents, didn't have one.
The only option for sending money was **money orders**, which took around 3-4 working days to reach the recipient.It would take 5 days for my family to receive the money after sending it, which demonstrates the lack of instant communication and financial transaction tools during that time.

## Scenario 2: Ordering Food In The Present Day

I want to eat outside food.This time I have plenty of money in my account, so I can afford it. However, I have to go to the restaurant and pick up the food, which would take around 30 minutes. Additionally, if any of my cousins were to come over unexpectedly, I would need to clean up my house. In the past, this would have been a burden. But today, thanks to online ordering applications like Swiggy or Zomato, I can quickly place an order and have the food delivered to my home. Meanwhile, I can organize my house, saving time and effort.

This scenario highlights how software applications have revolutionized our lives by providing convenience, saving time, and offering solutions that were not possible in the past.

 *Key Benefits:*
  - Time-saving.
  - Convenience.

These examples show how software applications have revolutionized our lives by solving everyday problems efficiently.

# Identifying Problems and Creating Solutions Through Software Applications

Companies like **Google Pay** and **Zomato** identified real-world problems and developed solutions.
- Google Pay addressed the issue of slow money transfers.
- Zomato made food ordering and delivery seamless.

The success of such applications lies in identifying problems around us and creating **innovative solutions** to address them.

**Not only do users benefit from these solutions, but the creators also profit** through commissions or other business models. This highlights how software applications resolve human issues and generate business opportunities simultaneously.

# Why Java
Java plays a pivotal role in:
- Handling backend logic efficiently.
- Creating interactive and dynamic software applications.
- Ensuring robust performance for enterprise-scale systems.
If you want to be part of building solutions like **Google Pay or Zomato, learning Java is a great starting point**.

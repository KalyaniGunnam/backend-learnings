# Programming

Programming is a way to instruct a computer to perform tasks in a specified manner. In our earlier discussion, we defined programming as a means of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. Now I would like to introduce one more term : Programming Paradigms.

# What is Programming Paradigm?

A **programming paradigm** is a method or approach that defines a set of principles, techniques and patterns for structuring code to solve problems on a computer. Programming paradigms can be broadly classified into two categories:

##### 1. Imperative Programming Paradigm (How to do): 
This paradigm focuses on describing how a program operates. It emphasizes explicit instructions on how to achieve a task step by step.
- **Subcategories**:
###### 1. Procedural Programming:
Programs are divided into procedures or functions.
Example: C, Pascal.
Key concept: Code reusability through functions.
###### 2.Structured Programming:
Focuses on improving code readability and reducing complexity by following structured flow (sequence, selection, iteration).
Example: Modern C, early Python.
###### 3.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
Organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.
Promotes concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
Example: Java, C++, Python.

#####  2. Declarative Programming Paradigm (What to do)
This paradigm focuses on describing what a program should accomplish, leaving the details of how itâ€™s done to the underlying system.
- **Subcategories**:
###### 1. Functional Programming:
Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions without changing state or data.
Example: Haskell, Scala, JavaScript (functional aspects).
###### 2.Logic Programming:
Uses formal logic to express rules and facts to derive conclusions.
Example: Prolog, Datalog.
###### 3.Database Programming:
Deals with querying and manipulating databases using structured query languages like SQL.
Example: SQL, MongoDB Query Language.

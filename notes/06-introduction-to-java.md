# Programming

Programming is a way to instruct a computer to perform tasks in a specified manner. In our earlier discussion, we defined programming as a means of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. Now I would like to introduce one more term : Programming Paradigms.

# What is Programming Paradigm?

A **programming paradigm** is a method or approach that defines a set of principles, techniques and patterns for structuring code to solve problems on a computer. Programming paradigms can be broadly classified into two categories:

## 1. Imperative Programming Paradigm (How to do): 
This paradigm focuses on describing how a program operates. It emphasizes explicit instructions on how to achieve a task step by step.

##### a) Procedural Programming:
-   Programs are divided into procedures or functions.
     - Example: C, Pascal.

##### b) Structured Programming:
-   Focuses on improving code readability and reducing complexity by following structured flow (sequence, selection, iteration).
     -  Example: Modern C, early Python.
    
##### c) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): 
-   Organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.
    -   Example: Java, C++, Python.


## 2. Declarative Programming Paradigm (What to do):
This paradigm focuses on describing what a program should accomplish, leaving the details of how it’s done to the underlying system.

##### a) Functional Programming:
-   Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions without changing state or data.
     - Example: Haskell, Scala, JavaScript (functional aspects).

##### b) Logic Programming:
-   Uses formal logic to express rules and facts to derive conclusions.
     -  Example:Prolog, Datalog.
    
##### c) Database Programming: 
-   Deals with querying and manipulating databases using structured query languages like SQL.
    -   Example:  SQL, MongoDB Query Language.

# Java 
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems and officially released in 1996. It was originally created by James Gosling in June 1991, but its first official version came out in 1996. Currently, Java is maintained by Oracle Corporation.

# Name behind Java(Oak to Java)
When James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems started developing the language in 1991, they initially named it "Oak". The inspiration came from an oak tree outside Gosling's office, symbolizing strength and reliability.

However, during preparations for the first public release, the team discovered that "Oak" was already trademarked by another company in the computer industry. This led to a brainstorming session for a new name.

The name "Java" was suggested, inspired by the coffee that fueled the team's long development sessions. They were particularly fond of a high-quality coffee named Java, which originates from the Indonesian island known for its coffee production. The name was chosen because it was:
- Simple and unique
- Modern and tech-savvy
- Representative of the team's energy

To reflect this connection, Java’s logo was designed as a steaming coffee cup. The language also has a famous tagline: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)—highlighting Java's revolutionary portability across platforms.

# Why Java Is Designed
Java was designed to be a platform-independent language, meaning compiled Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). While concepts like platform independence and JVM will be explained in detail later, for now, understand that this feature makes Java versatile and widely used.

Java supports the development of various types of applications, including:

- Mobile Applications: e.g., WhatsApp, LinkedIn
- Web Applications: e.g., Amazon, IRCTC
- Desktop Applications: e.g., Notepad, Calculator

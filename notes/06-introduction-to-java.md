# Programming

Programming is a way to instruct a computer to perform tasks in a specified manner. In our earlier discussion, we defined programming as a means of writing instructions that a computer can understand and execute. Now I would like to introduce one more term : Programming Paradigms.

# What is Programming Paradigm?

A **programming paradigm** is a method or approach that defines a set of principles, techniques and patterns for structuring code to solve problems on a computer. Programming paradigms can be broadly classified into two categories:

## 1. Imperative Programming Paradigm (How to do): 
This paradigm focuses on describing how a program operates. It emphasizes explicit instructions on how to achieve a task step by step.

##### a) Procedural Programming:
-   Programs are divided into procedures or functions.
     - Example: C, Pascal.

##### b) Structured Programming:
-   Focuses on improving code readability and reducing complexity by following structured flow (sequence, selection, iteration).
     -  Example: Modern C, early Python.
    
##### c) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): 
-   Organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes.
    -   Example: Java, C++, Python.


## 2. Declarative Programming Paradigm (What to do):
This paradigm focuses on describing what a program should accomplish, leaving the details of how itâ€™s done to the underlying system.

##### a) Functional Programming:
-   Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions without changing state or data.
     - Example: Haskell, Scala, JavaScript (functional aspects).

##### b) Logic Programming:
-   Uses formal logic to express rules and facts to derive conclusions.
     -  Example:Prolog, Datalog.
    
##### c) Database Programming: 
-   Deals with querying and manipulating databases using structured query languages like SQL.
    -   Example:  SQL, MongoDB Query Language.

# Java 
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun MicroSystems and released in 1996. Actually Java was developed by **James Gosling** in june 1991 but the first version java was officially released in 1996 by Sun MicroSystems. Currently it is being maintained by Oracle Corporation.

# Name behind Java(Oak to Java)
When James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems began developing the language in 1991, they initially named it "Oak". The name was chosen from an Oak Tree. There was a large oak tree outside Gosling's office at Sun Microsystems, which served as a source of inspiration. However, when the team was preparing for the first public release of the language, they discovered that "Oak" was already trademarked by another company in the computer industry.The team brainstormed alternative names. During one of their brainstorming sessions,the name "Java" was suggested.The team drank a lot of coffee while working on the project. They were particularly fond of a high-quality coffee called Java.The team felt this name was simple, unique and had a modern tech appeal. Hence the java logo was designed as a steaming coffee cup

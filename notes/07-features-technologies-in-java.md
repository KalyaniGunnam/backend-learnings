# Features Of Java

A feature refers to a key characteristics that making something standout and define its functionality, usability or uniqueness.  In the context of programming languages like Java, features are the distinctive qualities or capabilities that make the language effective and popular among developers. Let's explore the features of Java that make it distinct.

## 1.Object-oriented:
Java is an object oriented programming language which means, Java uses objects to represent real-world entitie, making the code more modular, reusable and maintainable.

In simple terms, think of an objects as a way to describe something we know like a car,person or a dog. Each object has: **Features(attributes)** and **Actions(Behaviors)**. Let's consider an example: If we consider car as an example - color of the car, height of the car, brand of the car - all these are features(attributes) of a car, While the car can drive, It can stop when breaks are applied, you can honk the horn - all thses are actions(behaviors) done by a car. 

## 2. Platform-Independent:
Java is a platform-independent language meaning compiled Java code can run on any device with JVM. This concept is called "WORA"(Write Once Run Anywhere).

Again for understanding I am considering an analogy here - Imagine you write a recipe on a piece of paper and anyone, anywhere in the world, can use it to cook, as long as they have the right tools in their kitchen. It doesn't matter if the kitchen is in India or in the USA or in Japanâ€”the recipe works everywhere.

Java works in a similar way. When you write Java code, it gets converted into a special "recipe" called **bytecode**. This bytecode can be used on any computer or device, as long as it has a tool called the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). So, you write the code once, and it can "run anywhere" without needing to be rewritten for different types of computers. This idea is called WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere), making Java very flexible and widely used.

What is JVM and all you will learn soon in Java architecture.

## 3.Simple:
Java is designed to be simple and easy to learn, with a clean and readable code.

## 4. Secure:
Java is secure due to its built-in security features like bytecode verification(again you will learn this in Java architecture) and absence of pointers. Hence Java has become one of the most secure option for networked applications.

## 5. Robustness:
Java is known for its robustness, since it has a strong memory management through garbage collection(again you will learn this in Java architecture) and also it includes extensive compile time and runtime error checking(what is runtime and compile time errors - you will clearly know once you start doing programming), which reduces the likelihood of bugs and crashes.

## 6. Multithreading:
One of the most important feature is multithreading.Java supports multi threading which can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making efficient use of modern multicore processors(We will go deep dive when we learn about multithreading concept).

## 7. High performance:
Last but not least Java achieves high performance through JIT compiler, which compiles bytecode into machine code at run time(again you will learn this in Java architecture), significantly boosting execution speed.

So overall Java combination of simplicity, robustness, security and platform independence makes a Java powerful tool for the wide range of applications.

Here we discussed the features of Java that make Java standout.There is also disadvantage in Java let's explore what it is.

# Disadvantage In Java

When designing User Interfaces (UI) purely with Java, without using additional libraries or frameworks, the resulting UI may often appear basic, outdated, or less polished compared to modern design standards. This happens because:
- Java's standard library for UI, such as AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing, provides only basic components and lacks the advanced, visually rich elements expected in modern applications.
- To make Java-based UIs look modern and appealing, developers need to write extensive custom code, which can be time-consuming and complex.

To overcome these challenges, developers often rely on modern Java UI frameworks or libraries such as **JavaFX**, or even integrate Java with web-based UI technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These tools provide advanced design capabilities, animations and responsive layouts, enabling developers to create visually appealing and user-friendly interfaces.

# What Are The Different Technologies Available In Java

There are three technologies available in Java.They are,
- **Java SE(Standard Edition)** for designing standalone applications. 
- **Java EE(Enterprise Edition)** for designing web applications. 
- **Java ME(Micro Edition)** for designing mobile applications.

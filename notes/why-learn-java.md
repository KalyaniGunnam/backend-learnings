# Why To Learn Java?

Before diving into Java, it's important to understand its significance compared to other programming languages and its areas of application. Many people, including myself, initially thought learning Java was unnecessary without knowing where and why it's used. Let's explore some stories about the Java programming language to grasp its importance and relevance in the real world.

# Where is Java Used?

Java is widely used in various fields, from web development to enterprise applications. To understand why Java is essential, letâ€™s look at an example:

Imagine you're visiting the Flipkart homepage. When you click the login button and enter your mobile number, the system checks whether the number is valid.

If the mobile number is incorrect, an error message will appear.
If the number is valid, an OTP (One-Time Password) will be sent to your mobile.
If the OTP entered is incorrect, an error message will indicate that the OTP is wrong.

How do these functionalities work behind the scenes on a software application (or website, from an end-user perspective)? These processes involve backend operations, which are crucial for creating interactive, dynamic websites and applications.

As developers, we refer to these as software applications, while users generally call them websites. Java plays a significant role in handling such functionalities efficiently, ensuring smooth user experiences.

# How Does the System Identify Invalid or Correct Information?

When you enter your mobile number on platforms like Flipkart, the system first checks whether the number is valid. If the mobile number is incorrect, the system will display an error message. If the number is correct, it will send an OTP to your mobile.

When you enter the OTP:

If the OTP is incorrect, the system will prompt you that the OTP is invalid.
If the correct OTP is entered, the system grants access and displays your account details, including your name, address, previous orders, and other information tied to your mobile number.
This process is similar on other platforms like Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, and many others. All these functionalities are handled by software applications that use backend logic to validate inputs and deliver real-time results.

# Why Do We Need Software Applications?

In the software industry, creating applications is essential for automating tasks, providing seamless user experiences, and managing vast amounts of data. Software applications help businesses run efficiently by enabling real-time interactions, processing information, and offering services in a secure and structured manner. But why exactly do we need software applications? Let's explore that next.

Let me provide you with some real-time scenarios to explain why software applications are crucial.

# Scenario 1: Sending Money in the 1980s

Imagine it's the 1980s, and I want to send money to my family, who live far away. What options do I have?

Back then, sending money instantly was not possible. Technology was not as advanced as it is today. At that time:

There was no PhonePe, Google Pay, or even proper bank accounts for everyone. Having a bank account was considered a status symbol, and many people, including my parents, didn't have one.
The only option for sending money was money orders, which took around 3-4 working days to reach the recipient.

It would take 5 days for my family to receive the money after sending it, which demonstrates the lack of instant communication and financial transaction tools during that time.

# Scenario 2: Ordering Food in the Present Day

Consider another scenario: I want to eat outside food. I have plenty of money in my account, so I can afford it. However, I have to go to the restaurant and pick up the food, which would take around 30 minutes. Additionally, if any of my cousins were to come over unexpectedly, I would need to clean up my house.

In the past, this would have been a burden. But today, thanks to online ordering applications like Swiggy or Zomato, I can quickly place an order and have the food delivered to my home. Meanwhile, I can organize my house, saving time and effort.

This scenario highlights how software applications have revolutionized our lives by providing convenience, saving time, and offering solutions that were not possible in the past.

In both of these scenarios, we see how software applications have drastically improved our daily lives by providing faster, more efficient alternatives to tasks that used to take longer or were impossible in the past. This is why software applications are essential in today's world.

# Identifying Problems and Creating Solutions Through Software Applications

What happens in scenarios like Google Pay or Zomato is that these companies identified real-world problems and developed solutions to make things easier for us. The key factor here is ideas. These companies saw gaps in our daily lives and created software applications to address those issues.

For example, Google Pay solved the problem of slow and outdated money transfer methods, while Zomato solved the problem of ordering food in an efficient way.  These are all human problems, and a set of individuals identified these issues and used their ideas to create solutions that benefit us today.

Not only are we benefiting from these applications, but the creators of these solutions are also earning through commissions or other business models.

So, to summarize, software applications are built to resolve human issues. The essence of startup ideas is identifying problems around us and creating solutions, which is exactly what these successful software applications have done.
